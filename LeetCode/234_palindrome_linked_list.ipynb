    "I have seen some people on the discussion forum saying it has to be O(n)O(n) because we're creating a new list. This is incorrect, because we are changing each of the pointers one-by-one, in-place. We are not needing to allocate more than O(1)O(1) extra memory to do this work, and there is O(1)O(1) stack frames going on the stack. It is the same as reversing the values in an Array in place (using the two-pointer technique).\n",

    "The downside of this approach is that in a concurrent environment (multiple threads and processes accessing the same data), access to the Linked List by other threads or processes would have to be locked while this function is running, because the Linked List is temporarily broken. This is a limitation of many in-place algorithms though.\n",
